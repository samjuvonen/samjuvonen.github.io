This is a blogospheric navel gazing kind of first post. It aims to have more
words than "Hello World", and "Testing". You Have Been Warned.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To blog or not to blog, that is the question. In my case it is perhaps
answered by the fact that this is published on my shiny new blog. Let's hope
I make it past the second post hurdle.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've made several attempts at blogging over the years since the idea was
young. Thankfully internet bitrot has eaten those away. I hope. This time is
different, ha!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The aims of this Yet Another Tech Blog are modest. I hope to use it to
organize my own thoughts. Writing in public is a good way to clarify the
goings-on in one's head-meat. Apart from this notes-to-self aspect I hope
it'll be useful for highlighting some solutions and tidbits I come across on
my virtual travels or develop myself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Wish me luck!
