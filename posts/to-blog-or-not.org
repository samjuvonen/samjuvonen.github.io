This is a blogospheric navel gazing kind of first post. It aims to have more
words than "Hello World", and "Testing". You Have Been Warned.

To blog or not to blog, that is the question. In my case it is perhaps
answered by the fact that this is published on my shiny new blog. Let's hope
I make it past the second post hurdle.

I've made several attempts at blogging over the years since the idea was
young. Thankfully internet bitrot has eaten those away. I hope. This time is
different, ha!

The aims of this Yet Another Tech Blog are modest. I hope to use it to
organize my own thoughts. Writing in public is a good way to clarify the
goings-on in one's head-meat. Apart from this notes-to-self aspect I hope
it'll be useful for highlighting some solutions and tidbits I come across on
my virtual travels or develop myself.

Wish me luck!
